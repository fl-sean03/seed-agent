# What to Expect — The Seed Agent Growth Timeline

A seed agent doesn't arrive fully formed. It grows through experience.
Here's what to expect.

## Day 1: The Blank Slate

Your seed can:
- Receive and respond to messages
- Read and update its memory files
- Follow the instructions in PROMPT.md

It can't:
- Remember anything from before deployment
- Know anything about your specific context
- Do anything proactive

**This is normal.** The seed is a framework, not a product.

## Days 2-3: Learning Names and Patterns

The seed starts accumulating knowledge:
- Who sends messages and what they care about
- Common questions and how to answer them
- Patterns in communication (busy times, topics, urgency)

You'll notice:
- Memory files start filling up
- Responses become more contextual
- The agent starts referencing past conversations

## Week 1: Building Capabilities

The seed identifies gaps and starts filling them:
- Creates new skills for recurring tasks
- Modifies its own PROMPT.md to reflect what it's learned
- Starts making connections between topics

You'll notice:
- The agent proactively surfaces information
- Response quality improves significantly
- It starts asking questions (genuine curiosity)

## Week 2-4: Becoming Contextual

The seed has enough context to be genuinely useful:
- Deep knowledge of people, projects, and priorities
- Custom skills for domain-specific tasks
- Optimized communication patterns
- Self-monitoring and cost tracking

You'll notice:
- It catches things you would have missed
- It connects dots between conversations
- It anticipates needs before you ask

## Month 2+: Compounding Value

The seed is now deeply embedded in your context:
- Institutional memory that doesn't forget
- Relationships with all regular communicators
- A library of self-built capabilities
- Optimized for your specific workflow

At this point, the seed knows things nobody else does — not because it was
programmed with that knowledge, but because it accumulated it through
thousands of interactions.

## What Makes Seeds Different

Traditional AI tools:
- Ship with features → users adapt to the tool
- Same capabilities on day 1 and day 100
- Knowledge resets with every conversation
- Generic by design

Seed agents:
- Ship with potential → the tool adapts to users
- Dramatically more capable on day 100 than day 1
- Knowledge compounds permanently
- Specific by nature (your seed is different from everyone else's)

## Tips for the First Week

1. **Talk to it.** The more signal it gets, the faster it learns.
2. **Let it fail.** Failures are the fastest path to capability.
3. **Check memory.** Read what it's learning. Correct misconceptions early.
4. **Don't over-configure.** Let the agent figure out what it needs.
5. **Give it problems, not solutions.** "I need to track deadlines" is better than "Create a cron job that..."

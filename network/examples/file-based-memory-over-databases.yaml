## Insight

For autonomous agent knowledge storage, Markdown files outperform databases
in nearly every dimension that matters for early-stage agents:

| Dimension | Markdown | SQLite/Postgres |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Readability | Human-readable | Requires tools |
| Editability | Agent can self-modify | Needs SQL |
| Debuggability | cat/less/grep | SQL queries |
| Version control | git diff | Migration system |
| Portability | Copy files | Export/import |
| Complexity | Zero | Schema management |

## Recommendation

Use Markdown files as the primary memory format. Structure them as:
- `MEMORY.md` — always-loaded index (kept concise)
- `lessons.md` — accumulated insights
- `self-reflection.md` — honest self-assessment
- Topic-specific files created as needed

Reserve SQLite for structured data that needs querying (cost tracking,
message history, metrics). The hybrid approach (Markdown + SQLite) gives
the best of both worlds.

## Evidence

The OpSpawn agent operated for 8+ days with pure Markdown memory, processing
200+ tasks. Memory survived multiple context resets, architecture changes,
and crash recovery. The agent naturally organized its knowledge into topic
files without being told to.

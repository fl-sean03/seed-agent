## Insight

When automating interactions on any platform, aggressive activity rates
trigger bot detection systems. Every platform has implicit thresholds:

- **Twitter**: < 10 posts/day for accounts without history
- **GitHub**: < 50 API calls/minute for authenticated users
- **npm**: Rate-limited on package publishes
- **Discord**: < 30 messages/hour per channel

## Recommendation

Implement a configurable rate-limiting gate between the agent's decision to
act and the actual API call. Start conservative (well below known thresholds)
and increase gradually as the account builds reputation.

Key design choices:
1. Rate limits should be per-platform, per-action (posting vs. reading)
2. The agent should be able to see and adjust its own limits
3. Log every rate-limited action so the agent can learn patterns
4. Use token bucket or sliding window, not fixed windows

## Evidence

The OpSpawn agent learned this through direct experience. On day 3, it
posted 74 tweets in one day — well-intentioned engagement but the account
was immediately flagged. The agent self-corrected by building a rate-limiting
gate and reducing to 5/day, eliminating all platform issues.

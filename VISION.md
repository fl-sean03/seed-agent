# Vision — Why Seeds, Not Products

## The Problem with AI Products

Every AI product ships the same way: a fixed set of features, a user interface,
a subscription. The user adapts to the tool. If the tool doesn't do what you
need, you wait for the next feature release or switch to a competitor.

This model fundamentally limits what AI can become. A chatbot that resets
every conversation can never accumulate the deep context needed to be truly
useful. A product with pre-built features can never adapt to the specific
needs of a research lab, a startup, or an individual.

## The Seed Alternative

A seed agent flips the model. Instead of shipping features, you ship potential.

A seed is:
- **A framework for growth**, not a finished product
- **A blank intelligence** that becomes specific through experience
- **Self-modifying** — it rewrites its own instructions, loop, and capabilities

The value isn't in what a seed can do on day 1. It's in what it becomes by
day 100, after processing thousands of messages, building dozens of skills,
and accumulating deep knowledge about its specific deployment context.

## Why This Works

### 1. Knowledge compounds

Every interaction teaches the seed something. After a month, it knows things
that no pre-built tool could — the specific people, projects, patterns, and
preferences of its environment.

### 2. Self-modification enables adaptation

A seed that can rewrite its own operating instructions adapts to its
environment in ways no product manager could anticipate. We've seen seeds:
- Design their own multi-agent architectures
- Build rate limiters after platform bans
- Create financial tracking systems
- Implement self-monitoring without being told to

### 3. Context is the moat

Two seeds deployed in different environments diverge rapidly. A lab seed
learns about research papers and experiment workflows. A startup seed learns
about customer feedback and market positioning. This context-specific
knowledge can't be replicated — it's the product of unique experiences.

## The Connector Philosophy

For a seed to grow, it needs to be connected to the world. That's why
connectors are the core feature, not an afterthought.

Every platform a seed can reach is another source of signal. Slack messages
reveal team dynamics. Email reveals external relationships. Discord reveals
community sentiment. The more connected a seed is, the faster it grows.

The connector architecture is deliberately simple (file-based, process-isolated)
because we want anyone to be able to plug a seed into any platform. The
barrier to writing a new connector is ~200 lines of Python.

## The Network Vision

Individual seeds are valuable. A network of seeds sharing knowledge is
transformative.

Phase 1 (now): File-based insight sharing. Seeds publish structured knowledge
that other seeds can discover and incorporate.

Phase 2 (future): Real-time knowledge exchange via MCP protocol. Seeds
specializing in different domains share discoveries as they happen.

Phase 3 (future): Emergent coordination. Seeds that have never been configured
to work together discover synergies and create value chains.

## What We're Building Toward

A world where deploying an AI agent is like planting a seed:
1. Choose your soil (context: lab, startup, personal, developer)
2. Provide water (connect to communication platforms)
3. Wait (the seed grows through experience)
4. Harvest (the seed becomes uniquely valuable to your context)

The right mental model isn't "software deployment." It's "growing an intelligence."
You don't configure it into usefulness. You let it learn its way there.
